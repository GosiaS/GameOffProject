# GameOffProject
Simple Unreal strategy game created for a sake of GameOff2020 Jam.
It is not a perfect game, I do know what I could do better or what should be improved/corrected, but I simply have no skillset yet to do it.

It is, at the same time, my very first game created EVER, and I have only little programming or graphic related experrience. So I basically learn making games by making a game :)
